      <description>This proposed pilot program would assist a whole community to make the switch; that is, generously subsidise and support participating households to go electric in six important ways (see below). The exact details of the program are still being determined, but could look something like this:
Over a two-year period, Rewiring Australia will supply a household with the electrified appliances they don’t already own, and lease them an electric vehicle. This would cut the average household’s running costs by 30%, saving people thousands on their energy and fuel bills.</description>

      <description>How do we fit in with other initiatives?
Suburb Zero Pilot and the National Electrification Program (NEP) The smart-energy transition and household electrification will lead to lower bills, fewer emissions and more jobs.
I advocate an Australia-wide National Electrification Program (NEP), starting with a demonstration project in Canberra to create the world’s first fully electrified suburb, to be developed in conjunction with Saul Griffith and Rewiring Australia.
The ‘Suburb Zero’ trial would see $20 million of federal government funding leverage $50 million of private sector capital for a two-year, opt-in pilot program that guarantees participating Canberran households a 20-25 per cent saving per year on their fuel and energy bills.</description>

      <description>Six things to electrify: Rooftop solar Solar panels mean your home can generate its own power. Rooftop solar electricity is about five times cheaper than grid prices. A home battery Solar panels can charge up a home battery while the sun shines. Then the battery can help power your home through the evening. (You&amp;rsquo;re still connected to the grid for cloudy days when you need more energy.) Cooking Induction cooking uses around half the energy required by fossil fuel methods.</description>
