>A: Electrify Canberra is a dedicated group of local people who share a passion for big ideas and positive change, working together on a voluntary basis. When we got word that Canberra could be the home of the electrification pilot, we came together to try to mobilise our community to bring it about. 

Weâ€™re working closely with Rewiring Australia.
