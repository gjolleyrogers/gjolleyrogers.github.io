A: The financial structure of the pilots can be designed to include everyone in the community, even those that do not have a car or roof space for solar.  The financial benefit that comes from replacing gas and grid electricity with cheap, locally produced solar can be shared.  The way to make this work is that all households would sign up to an electricity retailer that is participating in the pilot.  The retailer would offer reduced bills, regardless of how much rewiring a household is able to participate in.  People such as renters in flats can still sign up to a pilot and receive cheaper electricity (p.145)
