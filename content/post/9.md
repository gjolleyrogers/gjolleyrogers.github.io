A: We donâ€™t expect it will be - it will most likely be offered under a lease for the 2 year pilot program. 

The draft proposal is a leasing charge of 4 cents per kilometer to use the EV (for comparison, the average petrol vehicle costs 20 cents per kilometer to run), and you would have the option to purchase the EV at a discounted price at the end of the 2 year trial.
