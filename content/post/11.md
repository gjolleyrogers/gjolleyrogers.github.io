A: Electrifying our homes will not only slash our emissions it will also save households money on energy bills (p.89). By 2030 an electrified household will save on average $5000 per year on their energy and fuel costs.  Lower-income homes spend a higher proportion of their pay cheques (nearly double) on energy costs (p.95)
