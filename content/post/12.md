>A: As long as more than 60-70% of freestanding households enroll, the pilot will be a rigorous test of electrification.  The minimum grouping of households would be the 50 or so houses that take power from the same distribution transformer. (p.143)  A larger pilot would aggregate households connecting to adjacent distribution transformers.  The goal would be to scale a pilot so that it included every house connected to the neighbourhood substation.  Substations each feed power to about 1,000 homes.
