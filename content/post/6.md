A: We donâ€™t know the exact subsidies and benefits that will be offered yet, but the program will be heavily subsidised to make it compelling and affordable for as many households as possible. 

**Electrify 2515**, together with **Rewiring Australia**, is campaigning for funding from government agencies such as the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, state governments, and industry such as vehicle companies and appliance manufacturers.  A well-designed pilot would have government provided up to half the cost of all the devices, EVs, installation and project management.  Much of the capital would be in the form of a loan, which would be repaid over several years.  People could sign up to be part of the research phase of the pilot, which might go for two years, but they could keep the technology beyond that time.  The revenue to pay back the loans will come from household electricity bills.  Bundling all this income together via a single retailer will give a bank the confidence to lend against that annuity.  For the first pilots, it is likely that concessional finance would be required from the CEFC or other government lenders (p.145)

The pilots would cost up to $100 million and could be delivered by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency within its existing budget
