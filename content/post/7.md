* **Appliances and Home Battery**: As part of the proposed program, you would receive the electric home appliances you need free of charge - induction cooktop, split system air conditioner and heat pump hot water heater. 
 You would also be supplied with a home battery. 
 You would be able to keep these items at the end of the 2 year trial.

* **Rooftop Solar**: If you donâ€™t already have a rooftop solar system you would be provided one at a heavily subsidised price.
* **Electric Vehicle (EV)**:You would be leased an EV for the 2 year pilot program. You would be charged around 4 cents per kilometre to use the EV (the average petrol vehicle costs 20 cents per kilometre to run). You would have the option to purchase the EV at a discounted price at the end of the 2-year trial.
