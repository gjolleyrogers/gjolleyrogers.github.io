##  on the living world
Our impacts on biodiversity are profound and manifold. Apparent even in the simple measure of total mass of wild and domestic animals.

Humans and livestock now **exceed many times** the global combined weight of wild birds and mammals.

So in the very recent past, the whole earth ecosystem has changed. Much of the past flow of energy and resources has  been routed permanently to service a growing human population.  On geological scales,
