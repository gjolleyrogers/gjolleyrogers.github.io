 How do  we fit in with  other initiatives? 

## Suburb Zero Pilot and the National Electrification Program (NEP)

The smart-energy transition and household electrification will lead to lower bills, fewer emissions and more jobs.

I advocate an Australia-wide National Electrification Program (NEP), starting with a demonstration project in Canberra to create the world’s first fully electrified suburb, to be developed in conjunction with Saul Griffith and Rewiring Australia.

The ‘Suburb Zero’ trial would see $20 million of federal government funding leverage $50 million of private sector capital for a two-year, opt-in pilot program that guarantees participating Canberran households a 20-25 per cent saving per year on their fuel and energy bills.

The program would cover the costs of transitioning participating households to full electrification, including providing them with an electric vehicle (EV), rooftop solar, battery storage, all electric appliances, heat pumps and other appliances.

Households would be able to keep all installations at the end of the trial and have the option of purchasing the EV at a reduced cost.

I will work with the ACT government to make sure the program operates effectively alongside the ACT Sustainable Household Scheme.

The pilot program would create a massive pipeline of work for tradespeople, including huge opportunities to upskill and retrain, as well as ploughing some $2 million worth of cost savings each year on fuel and energy bills back into the local economy. It would also encourage the development of technical, financial and commercial solutions to the energy-system transformation that can inform the design of an Australia-wide NEP.

Research shows the NEP could be rolled out at a cost of around $12 billion over five years – roughly the same amount the Federal Government currently spends every year in annual fossil-fuel subsidies - and would reduce domestic emissions by 42 per cent while creating lower energy bills for households. Under the proposed policy, government investment would only account for a part of that total with the remainder coming from the private sector.
