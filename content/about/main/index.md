  #### MY NAME   {{< figure src="/images/hook.png" title="" class="fr">}}
  Before we were married I was Garry Rogers. <br>	My wife to be was Cynthia Jolley. 

  We hyphenated because it was just too good an opportunity to pass up - so we are now Cynthia and Garry Jolley-Rogers. When we met, Cynthia was working as Assistant Stage Manager on a production of Gilbert and Sullivans "Pirates of Penzance".

## Management
An experienced manager of teams and projects, I have overseen and collaborated on projects throughout the development cycle.

In scale, my projects have ranged from collaborative efforts (such as medium scale software development) to the independence of scientific research and analysis.

I have experience in all aspects of project lifecycles from Design and Implementation, to Verification and Quality Control.
