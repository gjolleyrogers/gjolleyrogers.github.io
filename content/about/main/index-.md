  I  am trained in __computer science__ and __neuroscience__. <br>
  I have worked as a  software engineer, programmer ,  IT manager, and researcher.  
Drawing on a core set of skills in lab science,  
 
analysis, modelling, informatics, and programming, I have had adventures in many disciplines.

 ## Rendering mathematical equations

Examples from the [mathjax demo](https://www.mathjax.org/#demo).
But they work with `katex` as well.

### Rmarkdown

In `.Rmarkdown` documents, you can use either

```
$a \ne 0$
```

to get inline math: `\(a \ne 0\)`.
There is no conflict with using dollar symbols regularly, because `knitr` automatically escapes freestanding dollar symbols.

And you can use

```
$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
```

to get a math paragraph:

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

### md

In `.md` documents, you can **not** use the single dollar syntax.
The double dollar syntax still gives you a math paragraph.

```
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
```

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$

In order to get inline equations, use:

```
`\(a \ne 0\)`
or
\\(a \ne 0\\)
```

to get: `\(a \ne 0\)`.

For example, this panelset:

{{< panelset class="greetings" >}}
{{< panel name="Hello! :wave:" >}}
  hello
{{< /panel >}}
{{< panel name="Goodbye :dash:" >}}
  goodbye
{{< /panel >}}
{{< /panelset  >}}

Was created by combining this theme's `panelset` and `panel` shortcodes:

```go
{{</* panelset class="greetings" */>}}
{{</* panel name="Hello! :wave:" */>}}
  hello
{{</* /panel */>}}
{{</* panel name="Goodbye :dash:" */>}}
  goodbye
{{</* /panel */>}}
{{</* /panelset */>}}
```


You could also revert to HTML as well. For example, this panelset:


<div class="panelset">
  <div class="panel">
    <div class="panel-name">Question</div>
    <!-- Panel content -->
    <p>Which came first: the :chicken: or the :egg:?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="panel">
    <div class="panel-name">Answer :hatching_chick:</div>
    <!-- Panel content -->
    <p>Team :egg: FTW!</p>
  </div>
</div>

Was created with this HTML code:

```html
<div class="panelset">
  <div class="panel">
    <div class="panel-name">Question</div>
    <!-- Panel content -->
    <p>Which came first: the :chicken: or the :egg:?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="panel">
    <div class="panel-name">Answer :hatching_chick:</div>
    <!-- Panel content -->
    <p>Team :egg: FTW!</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
