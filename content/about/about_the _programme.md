This proposed pilot program would assist a whole community to make the switch; that is, generously subsidise and support participating households to go electric in six important ways (see below). The exact details of the program are still being determined, but could look something like this:

Over a two-year period, Rewiring Australia will supply a household with the electrified appliances they don’t already own, and lease them an electric vehicle. This would cut the average household’s running costs by 30%, saving people thousands on their energy and fuel bills. At the end of the two years, households would get to keep the appliances and have the option to buy the EV at a discount.

Modelling by Rewiring Australia shows that by 2030, total electrification would create the following benefits for the ACT:

* Savings per average ACT household per year: $5,173

* Total fuel and energy savings for the ACT per year: $912,870,545

* Added local economic stimulus per year from fuel and energy savings: $581,725,807

* Total jobs created: 5,595
