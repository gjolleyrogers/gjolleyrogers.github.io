  Hi there! Welcome.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->


I am an independent researcher and author. Drawing on a core set of skills in biology, maths, and computer science, I have had adventures in many disciplines.

<i class="fas fa-edit"></i> On the [blog](/blog/) I  write about develop ideas   I judge to be noteworthy.  

In **no way** do I think anything I write here is the last word on a subject.  And  it is likely that mistakes and typos may slip through. So, don't hesitate to get in touch if you see something that <i class="fas fa-bug pr2"></i> bugs you.

 I welcome and encourage all respectful [feedback](/contact/).
