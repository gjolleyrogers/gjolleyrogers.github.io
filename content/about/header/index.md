I am an independant researcher and author. Drawing on a core set of skills in biology, maths, and computer science, I have had adventures in many disciplines. 
 
   I a few long term passion projects in train - some science, some writing, some mucking around, and some observing.
 
  I am open to providing web support for community projects I admire.
