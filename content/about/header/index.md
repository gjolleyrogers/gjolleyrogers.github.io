  Hi there! Welcome.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->


I am an independant researcher and author. Drawing on a core set of skills in biology, maths, and computer science, I have had adventures in many disciplines.

On the [blog](/blog/) I am write about ideas I am developing or matters that I judge to be noteworthy. In **no way** do I think anything I write here is the last word on a subject.  And  it is likely that mistakes and typos may slip through. So, don't hesitate to get in touch if you see something that bugs you. I welcome and encourage all respectful [feedback](/contact/).
