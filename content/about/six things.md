# Six things to electrify:

## Rooftop solar
>Solar panels mean your home can generate its own power. Rooftop solar electricity is about five times cheaper than grid prices.

## A home battery
>Solar panels can charge up a home battery while the sun shines. Then the battery can help power your home through the evening. (You're still connected to the grid for cloudy days when you need more energy.)

## Cooking
>Induction cooking uses around half the energy required by fossil fuel methods. Not only is electric cooking cheaper, it also saves your household from harmful gas stove pollutants known to cause respiratory illness.

## Heating
>Typical reverse-cycle air conditioners are the most efficient way to heat your home, using just 25-30% of the energy required by conventional gas or electric systems.

## Hot water
>Heat pumps are the most efficient way to heat water for bathing, washing up, etc. Heat pumps use around a quarter of the energy required by conventional hot water systems.

## An Electric Vehicle (EV)
>Electric Vehicles are the most efficient cars. EVs convert more than 77% of electrical energy into power. Petrol vehicles convert only 12-30% of petrol energy into power.
