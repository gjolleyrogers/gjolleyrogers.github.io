 The Electrify Canberra initiative is 100% volunteer-driven. This website is administered by the Electrify 2515 Committee - a group of local people from all walks of life, dedicated to advancing climate action in our own community and throughout Australia.

Have further questions? You can contact us at electrify2515@gmail.com or complete this form. 

If you don’t receive a response straight away, please be patient. This inbox is administered by volunteers with many other life commitments on the go! :)
