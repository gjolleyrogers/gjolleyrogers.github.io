# Together, let‚Äôs electrify Canberra!
 
### It's  practical and saves money.
 
![logo](/images/logo.png)
There is a unique opportunity for households to take part in a proposed (world-first!) pilot project to electrify a whole community. We can make our cars and homes run more efficiently, powered by renewable energy. 


Rewiring Australia wants to subsidise and support at least XXX households in a single community to go electric in six important ways. We think Canberra could be that community!
  
   
  ##   Sound good?

Save money, save the planet, improve your home, and provide work for local installers... what do you have to lose? This is a unique and exciting opportunity to electrify our homes and community. To get it off the ground, we need at least 500 households willing to participate.

Please register your interest in participating (this is not a commitment) by completing a short [Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczkeE0AO29paB00XKiNSKpkaRoQpiI1O3HJjZ67yf1ENYw6w/viewform) [^1].
